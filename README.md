# Demographics Health Risks

With data from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, we are able to assess possible correlations between demographic data and a viariety of health outcomes by state.

Depicted in this analysis is the relationship between poverty rate and obesity rate. Without calculating an r-value, it is difficult to determine if there is a strong correlation between the two, however, at a glance there is what appears to be some degree of correlation. In general, as the poverty rate increases, so does the obesity rate.

Further analysis would include looking for possible outliers, determining the strength of the relationship as well as creating dynamic axes that would show the relationships between more demographics and health outcomes.
